# music-vue-nuxt-spa

This project uses the iTunes API.  You can search for a specific musician and view their albums.  You can also listen to samples of the songs from the album.  This is built on nuxt.js (SPA) and element.  You may find a demo [here](https://davidjamesherzog.github.io/music-vue-nuxt-spa/).

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
